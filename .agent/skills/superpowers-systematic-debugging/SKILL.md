# Systematic Debugging

## Overview
Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

## The Iron Law
```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use
Use for ANY technical issue: test failures, bugs, unexpected behavior, performance problems, build failures, integration issues.

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work

## The Four Phases

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation
**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully** - Don't skip past errors. Read stack traces completely. Note line numbers, file paths, error codes.
2. **Reproduce Consistently** - Can you trigger it reliably? What are the exact steps?
3. **Check Recent Changes** - Git diff, recent commits, new dependencies, config changes.
4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems** - Log what data enters/exits each component. Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks.
5. **Trace Data Flow** - Where does bad value originate? Keep tracing up until you find the source. Fix at source, not at symptom.

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis
1. **Find Working Examples** - Locate similar working code in same codebase
2. **Compare Against References** - Read reference implementation COMPLETELY
3. **Identify Differences** - List every difference, however small
4. **Understand Dependencies** - What other components does this need?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing
1. **Form Single Hypothesis** - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
2. **Test Minimally** - Make the SMALLEST possible change. One variable at a time.
3. **Verify Before Continuing** - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis. DON'T add more fixes on top.

### Phase 4: Implementation
1. **Create Failing Test Case** - Simplest possible reproduction
2. **Implement Single Fix** - Address root cause. ONE change at a time.
3. **Verify Fix** - Test passes? No other tests broken?
4. **If 3+ Fixes Failed** - STOP and question the architecture. Discuss before attempting more fixes.

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process
If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

## Common Rationalizations
| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem |
